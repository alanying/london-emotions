Here are the good points. The room was very spacious and had everything needed including a nice big bed. The bathroom had a proper shower and space for toiletries. There was wifi and breakfast included. Now for the bad, on Sunday and Monday morning I was queuing for breakfast and was told by a member of staff to go to the other side where it said no entry. When I did that another member of staff said the queues over there. Then I tried to explain what I was told by the first member of staff but unfortunately she didn't understand much english. These mixed messages shouldn't happen. I've got no problem with people not being english but if you're going to work in a hotel or similar accommodation you need to know and understand the basics. Also this member of staff that didn't know much english kept staring at me when I was eating. The other bad thing was later on Sunday morning I had gone down to reception to ask about cleaning which I was given a bit of paper about that said I had to choose a 4 hour slot in advance which is fair enough but it failed to mention that cleaning was between 9am and 1pm which I found out from the member of staff who expected me to already know. Then I said can I have the cleaning the next day (Monday) between 9 and 10am and she said no because it has to be 4 hour slot. I said well how am I supposed to choose a 4 hour slot when 9am until 1pm is 4 hours. She then ignored me and spoke to the person behind me who also wanted cleaning done the next day. He asked for an hour slot after 12pm. I waited until he'd gone because it wasn't his fault. It was the staff's fault. I did have a go at the member of staff for ignoring me and for not treating me the same as as the man. I did swear a bit but only out of frustration and not directed at anyone. I then went up to my room and when I came back down to resolve the situation and apologise for swearing the staff member apologised to for not treating me fairly and said my room would be cleaned the next day at the time I wanted. So I then thought everything was fine but Tuesday morning I went to meet with my social worker who told me the hotel staff wanted me to leave even though it had been resolved.

There is a problem with some kind of intentional discrimination:

Is it because we are disabled, coming for promotion offer or we do not order a drink?

It all started with me and partner coming in with a sandwich from outside and started eating at one of the 20 tables in the lobby area. First off a second receptionists comes to us other thn mark comes to us and rudely advises us that you need to register the car or it will be towed while we had started eating. Upon advising that we have a room here and the car has been registered since day 1, he leaves from our table . The second short heighted receptionist named Mark? Walks and orders us that we immediately take our sandwiches to our rooms. Upon that I advised him that a review will be on the internet. He accuses me that was a threat. Me and family were here for business staying in rooms 127, 131 and 313 all with the same last names and we wont be returning . They are too cheap to even give a 2nd coffee, when we booked with breakfast included. The overall condition of the hotel reflects with the cheapness of the management. To add, they rent to people dependent on council to pay for their housing. Junkies walk around the lobby and the parking lot asking them to buy meals inside or cigarettes. I bought the first 2 meals but soon came to know off the situation. I'm talking about grown fit able men. Also the pictures are very deceiving.

I called and reception said to contact

amer.ashfaq@marriotthotels.com

No response from writing

"" I was quite put off from staying again at a Marriott Hotel.
The room was quite 'tired' decor wise - bathroom quite grubby and the curtain actually fell off and landed on me when trying to draw the curtains.
I stay on average 4 hotels a week and this has been one of the poorest value for the price.

I then went to get a meal and waited 10 mins for anyone to actually acknowledge me.
The food (steak and chips) was poor quality - chips undercooked and steak grisly.
Nobody came to check on food so I ended up having to eat what was provided.
I again waited ages to pay, however as the waiter had been more insistent on getting my room number instead of checking the meal was ok I returned to room.

A bit later the waiter then persistently banged on the hotel room door and woke me up, shoving a card payment machine in my face demanding payment. I stated I wished an invoice and expressed dissatisfaction at the meal. He tutted and stormed off.
This is absolutely disgusting and harassment.

I then see I have just been charged anyway and have yet to receive any VAT receipt or invoice as requested several times.
I don't even know if I have paid for the parking, however I called down to reception and have it on call recording that writing my reg number on check in paper was sufficient.
I suspect this is not and I will get a ticket.

Sort this out otherwise I will reverse the card payments as unauthorised. I suspect I will not be in a position to leave a favourable review either.

The facilities were okay; the steam room was nice but I think it‚Äôs a bit on the older side so there‚Äôs a tad bit of water collection on the ceiling of the steam room and when it drops down it‚Äôs quite hot on skin. Also, the diffusion of steam isn‚Äôt equal - you have to sit right at the top to feel the steam. The sauna was really lovely and up to par. The shower facilities were up to par. The jacuzzi felt a bit cold for the temperature I‚Äôm used to in a jacuzzi, however the size of the jacuzzi is really nice. I did enjoy it regardless of the temperature. The swimming was really nice, 1.2m all the way through. When we were in the pool there was a swimming lesson going on. So there were tons of mothers waiting for their kids and watching us swim etc. It sort of felt like being at the community swimming baths at noon during the summer holidays.

In this regard, I am now writing a complaint about what I encountered on 1st, Sep. That morning, a cleaner had broken into my room and took away my belongings before I checked out. Among them, four bottles of perfume and some of my personal items such as my notebook were lost. When I came back, seeing this, I soon reported to the reception. 5 minutes later, a lady with glasses came to my room, grasping some of my belongings from a black cleaning bag, and quickly putting them on the table in a panic. I found one bottle of Jo Malone (Red Rose, 100ml) lost, and the packages of all the cosmetics I bought as gifts were broken.

On the grounds that the cleaner could not understand me in English, only mumbling ‚Äúsorry‚Äù, I told the reception that I needed to talk with her manager. After around 10 minutes, a lady came here and apologized to me, while I told her about my loss. Out of sympathy and understanding of how hard life could be in this tough period, I  also promised her I would double check my luggage downstairs to see whether my lost belonging could be in it, and I would forgive the cleaner her intrusion if I could have the perfume back. I then poured all the stuff out of my two suitcases, still not finding my Jo Malone.

I then came to the reception for the third time that morning, asking for an explanation.  At first, the manager tried to convince me that the cleaner just kept my items as ‚Äúlost property‚Äù which the hotel normally keeps 6 moths  for its customer. Listening to her  clarification, I felt a sense of irony and told her I saw the cleaner taking my notebook  for the bag that was also used to contain rubbish. The manager soon apologized and retracted her previous explanation. Finally, she asked me for my phone number, and promised the company would negotiate with me on the compensation.

Today is the fifth day after that intrusion, and I finally realized my forgiveness and understanding could never bring me the the compensation I deserve. So I am currently requesting a written apology and the financial compensation, 98 pounds, which is equal to  the cost of my lost perfume whose transaction record I could provide.

If there was an option of minus ratings for customer service, it‚Äôs bottom tier.
For some reason the staff at this property have a bad attitude towards queries and finding resolutions for their customers. After experiencing such awful customer service scrolling through past reviews of this property are 100% accurate on the customer service, attitude from the staff and policies.

Made a booking through Booking.com, it was my first time booking an apartment to stay at, not realising there are age restrictions. Received a call from the property saying I cannot access the property because I‚Äôm not 25, I responded in a calm manner I‚Äôm 24 not a child, there was no need to respond is a rude manner. Clearly, these people have no respect for anyone that is under the age of 25, yet they are quick to take pre-payments, cancellation fees and deposits?
Ali, the guy who called me said I should take this issue up with booking.com. Which I did, Booking.com on the other hand, were more helpful friendly and polite in handling this issue and helping come to a resolve.
Rang the apartment back myself and a female staff responded to the query ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going over this 50 times, I‚Äôm not doing this again, whatever I‚Äôm not dealing with this‚Äô and hung up the phone in midst of asking a question. Who is the one under the age of 25 here? Refused access but cannot handle a problem as an adult on the phone ?

Ali said he will have to refuse me access to come to the property as I‚Äôm no 25, fair enough so I took it up with booking.com to come to a resolution. They denied a refund, wavier cancellation fee and also my deposit. When I already pre-paid. Now also, want to raise the issue of a ‚ÄòNo-show‚Äô. How can I show up to a property if I will get refused access? How can I come to an apartment I already PAID for and check in if they won‚Äôt allow me.

Do NOT book with these guys, they are more interested in taking your money from cancellation, rather than dealing with an issue in a polite manner where you can find resolutions. I even offered to pay more if I could move the date, and still no. All too good to be true.

I was checked-in as soon as I arrived, much to my surprise as I arrived at 9am. My room was clean, spacious and faced a quiet residential street. A king-size bed, large tv, mini-fridge,  an armchair and a large desk. The bathroom was compact but perfect for me as a lone traveller. The bath was a tad narrow and the handrail was a little bit loose so I was wary of using to haul myself out of the tub. I managed to get out of the bath with as much dignity as I could muster.

The room had a powerful air-conditioning which was handy as the weather was scorching hot so coming back to a cool room was heavenly.

The staff were unfailingly helpful and friendly and were highly knowledgable about the local area.

The only problem I encounter was my safe failed to lock. I informed reception and they sent someone to fix it but they couldn‚Äôt so I just left my laptop in my suitcase.

Here are the good points. The room was very spacious and had everything needed including a nice big bed. The bathroom had a proper shower and space for toiletries. There was wifi and breakfast included. Now for the bad, on Sunday and Monday morning I was queuing for breakfast and was told by a member of staff to go to the other side where it said no entry. When I did that another member of staff said the queues over there. Then I tried to explain what I was told by the first member of staff but unfortunately she didn't understand much english. These mixed messages shouldn't happen. I've got no problem with people not being english but if you're going to work in a hotel or similar accommodation you need to know and understand the basics. Also this member of staff that didn't know much english kept staring at me when I was eating. The other bad thing was later on Sunday morning I had gone down to reception to ask about cleaning which I was given a bit of paper about that said I had to choose a 4 hour slot in advance which is fair enough but it failed to mention that cleaning was between 9am and 1pm which I found out from the member of staff who expected me to already know. Then I said can I have the cleaning the next day (Monday) between 9 and 10am and she said no because it has to be 4 hour slot. I said well how am I supposed to choose a 4 hour slot when 9am until 1pm is 4 hours. She then ignored me and spoke to the person behind me who also wanted cleaning done the next day. He asked for an hour slot after 12pm. I waited until he'd gone because it wasn't his fault. It was the staff's fault. I did have a go at the member of staff for ignoring me and for not treating me the same as as the man. I did swear a bit but only out of frustration and not directed at anyone.

ChIJd1wNDl4bdkgRlwwnBMzQvc0,51.5345694,-0.0987222,"An institution. The kind of perennial neighbourhood place that has ceased to surprise you but consistently delivers on the high expectations it set when it once did.

The bar is magnificent, worth going to just to be in, big, bright, open and full of big tables. If you‚Äôre eating try and get a table in the restaurant section at the back. If you‚Äôre catching the late summer evening light, get a table outside. There‚Äôll randomly be a box of surplus apples or kiwis or something by the front door for people to take home. There are board games.

The food is very, very good. I have ceased to be surprised, as I said, but the quality of the ingredients is so good (particularly the vegetables which I presume come from the farm associated with the restaurant) that I am regularly delighted. The fact that it‚Äôs organic doesn‚Äôt excite my ethics enough to see past what is sometimes a relatively pedestrian menu, but it‚Äôs clear that that leaning on good ingredients is what gives The Duke it‚Äôs theme, and what makes it so reliable.

I don‚Äôt drink the wine (but I assume it‚Äôs great), the whiskey menu is good (but I don‚Äôt drink whiskey). The beer selection is very acceptable,there is always something excellent to drink. The fact that not all the beers on sale are organic probably says something about organic beer (...does anyone care if their beer is organic?), and there are often some wasted taps given to dull options that fit with the theme of the restaurant. But they always have something very good on tap and normally have bottles of Kernel in the fridge.

This place has it all, but I think I was sold by the beautiful interior and 17th century fireplace which had a fire going. Nice seating, friendly staff and beautiful decorations made for a great experience.
The Sunday roast was what I had come for though so let's talk about that. I am extremely critical of a roast so I don't take these things lightly.
We had the chicken roast and the beef roasts with a side of the cauliflower cheese. Starting with that, this cauliflower cheese was one of the best I've ever had with a mix of cheeses I couldn't put my finger on. Creamy, cheesy and delicious with the cauliflower cut up nice and small to maximize cheese!.
The roasts were a thing of perfection, with the star strangely being the gravy. Normally a second thought but here each dish had its own type and they were so good. The tender chicken and well cooked beef meant everything was great. Along with them came roast potatoes, which had been seasoned! Can't tell you how shocked I am to find so many places serving up plain potatoes.
There were also roasted carrots. They were sliced long and charred, something totally new to me and I was sold.
Along with some kale, parsnips and massive Yorkshire puddings, we left very stuffed and very happy!

I was checked-in as soon as I arrived, much to my surprise as I arrived at 9am. My room was clean, spacious and faced a quiet residential street. A king-size bed, large tv, mini-fridge,  an armchair and a large desk. The bathroom was compact but perfect for me as a lone traveller. The bath was a tad narrow and the handrail was a little bit loose so I was wary of using to haul myself out of the tub. I managed to get out of the bath with as much dignity as I could muster.

The room had a powerful air-conditioning which was handy as the weather was scorching hot so coming back to a cool room was heavenly.

The staff were unfailingly helpful and friendly and were highly knowledgable about the local area.

The only problem I encounter was my safe failed to lock. I informed reception and they sent someone to fix it but they couldn‚Äôt so I just left my laptop in my suitcase.

Staff of this restaurant is discriminative against the disabled people.

Me and my wife are both disabled (wheelchair-users). We used to like this restaurant.

There is a problem with some kind of intentional discrimination:

14th October 2020 we have been waiting from 5.30 pm till 7.15  pm. to take our order.

Is it because we are disabled, coming for promotion offer or we do not order a drink?

I have removed a couple of stars because as other reviewers have also said, we had a small, suspicious looking yellow stain on the crisp white duvet cover and there were small black marks on the fresh pillow cases so perhaps they need to examine housekeeping and laundry practices more thoroughly? There were also bits of dirt and fluff and a small feather in the corner of the room which implies they are not vacuuming all parts of the room thoroughly enough (so much for extra safety protocols in the midst of a pandemic!).

On the positive side, we were allowed an early check (and on departure, a late checkout) in which was greatly appreciated and it was quiet in the hotel for most of our stay. There was no room service menu available due to the pandemic but they did bring a mini breakfast upto our room inside brown carrier bags and some coffee in takeaway plastic cups. Housekeeping was on a request-only basis due to the pandemic but that was fine with us. The bathrooms are very clean and tidy, albeit a bit small but that is London for you generally. If you are a tall person and have to raise the showerhead higher, it tends to splash over the shower screen into the toilet area which is not the most hygienic situation.

Staff are very friendly, as i said they offered us both an early check-in and a late checkout and were hospitable and professional.

The location is fantastic with plenty of eateries around although not all are open due to the pandemic and if you use the footbridge at the back of the hotel, you literally end up in the middle of Canary Wharf so the hotel is situated rather perfectly. Although the hotel is on a main (and usually busy) road and almost directly opposite a DLR station in the financial capital of London, we heard no noise, except for the odd door banging from neighbouring guests.

The people behind the bar who took the food order were brilliant. Service was excellent, The IPA beer was great.
However I did not enjoy the food as much as the previous time.

The calamari rings were too thin so it was difficult to taste the calamari inside. Its a shame as it appears corners have been cut to offset the discount.

The other starter,  Green papaya asked was fresh but  lacked flavour due to the absence of herbs and spices.

The fried chicken burger was good. The chips accompanying the burger  were too oily and not great.

The vegetarian jackfruit burger did not  taste of jackfruit and felt more like the bean burgers you used to get 10 years ago. The patty was not that flavoursome and was oily.
Again the chips accompanying this burger was not good.

Not sure if the chef has changed. I felt it was cooked by someone without  an expert understanding of vietnanese herbs and spices.  Maybe something the owners need to address.

The second night was offered at a 50% discount due to bad unacceptable service.

I have instructed a legal firm now to act for me after an employee of the hotel valet parked my car and severely damaged it.

The general manager adam lake should not be representing this hotel as he is very unprofessional and ignorant not what you would expect from a mayfair hotel.

I felt that I was dealing with a 2 star hotel at best and felt very uncomfortable speaking to him  after he eventually decided to speak to me.

He was very rude and aggressive and told me either I listen to him or If I engage a law firm all correspondence will end.

Myself and my family are in complete shock over what has happened.

The staff wore  medical masks which was startling and on the first night when we asked for balsamic vinegar the waiter came back with a bottle of malt vinegar saying he has been to a shop and this is all he could get.

The manager said in his own words after I told him I would certainly leave an adverse review ‚ÄòI look forward to it.

There is an undesirable undertone to this as advertised  so called luxury hotel.

Please do not be fooled by the false facade and welcome  by the staff on arrival.
